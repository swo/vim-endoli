# vim-entoli.vim

This is a pun on "εντολή", the Greek word for "a command". I want to be able to
type a Greek letter in command mode and get the response my fingers expect from
vim. So pressing "ξ" should do what "j" would do.

## To do

- Wrap everything in functions, so you can turn it on and off
- Figure out what to do about W and ;
